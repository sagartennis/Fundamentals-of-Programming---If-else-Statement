# Fundamentals-of-Programming-If-else-Statement

The If else statement is used to execute a block of code to satisfy one single condition.  The If condition executes the statement only if the condition proves to be True.

In the If statement, Java has the following conditional statements:

1. Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true

2. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false


## Problem ##

These two numbers, 4 and 5. Print that 5 is greater than 4. The If statement will evaluate the condition 5 > 4. Since we know this is true, the end statement will print 5 is greater than 4.
